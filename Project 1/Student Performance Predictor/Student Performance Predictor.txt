# Student Performance Predictor

This project predicts whether a student will pass or fail based on the number of study hours using Logistic Regression.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-learn

## How it Works
- The dataset contains 10 student entries with hours studied and result (0 = Fail, 1 = Pass).
- A Logistic Regression model is trained and evaluated.
- A custom prediction is made based on 6.5 hours of study.

## Output
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy & Precision from classification report
- Predicted result for 6.5 hours
